We want to have a lot of progress. 
If we work together, this isn't gonna happen. 
Let's split up and work on separate objectives and then come together to write the milestone paper.

John & Brian: Process Data as much as we can
Azure: Figure out how to get Diffusion-LM running

Goal: Get this done on Monday and see where we can go from there.
